            <h2> My name is BAM and living the simple life saved my life </h2>

            <p>
                <strong> I used to be a pack rat. </strong>  I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
            </p>    
            
            <h3> How I turned things around </h3>
            
            <p>
                <strong> I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. </strong> I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. 
            </p>

            <p>
                It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
            </p>

            <h3> Now I live the simple life </h3>

            <p>
                Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
            </p>

            <p>
                With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
            </p>
